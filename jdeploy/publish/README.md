# ParticleSimulation

(getting last few touches in before an official release)

This is a simulation between different "species" of particles, each species has its own color, mass and radius.

Some species love each other, some hate eachother

A careful combination of love and hate is the base for artificial life

Each particle behaves like a organell, the right combination of organells can create a cell


TODO
- add replay mode that goes back 5sec
- add custom mode to save configuration so that you can restore it later on
- polish user configuration
- expore openGL and how can it improve performance
- add mode that switches between the default simulation and one that uses Newton's law of universal gravitation
